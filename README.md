# 🐳 **The Big Picture**

## 📌 1. Containers from 30,000 feet

Before diving deep, we’ll take a **bird’s-eye view** of containers — what they are, why they exist, and how they changed the software industry.

* **The bad old days** 🏚️ → How we used to manage apps before containers (manual installs, conflicts, heavy VMs).
* **Hello VMware!** 💻 → Virtualization made things easier, but still resource-heavy.
* **VMwarts** 🐌 → The inefficiencies and pain points of VMs.
* **Hello Containers!** 📦 → Lightweight, fast, isolated, and portable.
* **Linux containers** 🐧 → How Linux kernel features (namespaces, cgroups) made containers possible.
* **Hello Docker!** 🐳 → The project that made containers mainstream.
* **Docker and Windows** 🪟 → Containers beyond Linux.
* **What about Wasm?** 🌐 → WebAssembly as the future of lightweight execution.
* **Docker and AI** 🤖 → How containers power machine learning and AI workloads.
* **What about Kubernetes?** ☸️ → Scaling containers at the enterprise level.

## 📌 2. Docker and Container-related Standards

To understand Docker fully, we need to look at **standards and projects** that shape the container ecosystem.

* **Docker** 🐳 → CLI, Engine, Images, and Registries.
* **Container-related standards & projects** 🔗 → OCI (Open Container Initiative), containerd, CRI-O, Podman, etc.

## 📌 3. Getting Docker 🛠️

Hands-on section: learn how to **install and set up Docker** on different platforms.

* **Docker Desktop** 🖥️ → For Windows & macOS users.
* **Installing Docker with Multipass** ⚡ → A smooth way to run Docker inside lightweight VMs.
* **Installing Docker on Linux** 🐧 → The native way, with package managers or official scripts.

## 📌 4. The Big Picture 🌍

Now that Docker is running, let’s zoom out and see the **roles and benefits** for different teams.

* **The Ops Perspective** 🛡️ → Reliability, scalability, monitoring, and simplified deployments.
* **The Dev Perspective** 💡 → Faster development cycles, reproducible builds, and freedom from “it works on my machine” problems.
