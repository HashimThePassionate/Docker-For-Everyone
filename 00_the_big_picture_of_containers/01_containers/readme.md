# 📦 **Containers from 30,000 Feet**

Containers have taken over the world! 🌍
In this section, you’ll learn **why we have containers, what they do for us, and where we can use them.**

## 🕰️ The Bad Old Days

Applications are the powerhouse ⚡ of every modern business.
When applications break, businesses break.

* Most applications ran on servers.
* In the past, we were limited to **running one application per server**.

👉 This created a **big problem**:

* Every time a business needed a new application → it had to **buy a new server**.
* We weren’t very good at predicting the performance requirements of new apps.
* To avoid underpowered servers, companies bought **bigger, faster, more expensive servers** than necessary.

⚠️ Result:

* Racks of overpowered servers 🖥️🖥️🖥️ operating at just **5–10% of their capacity**.
* Massive **waste of company capital 💸** and **environmental resources 🌱**.

## 💡 Hello VMware!

Then came **VMware, Inc.** with a gift 🎁 → **the Virtual Machine (VM)**.

✨ What VMs did:

* Allowed **multiple business applications** to run safely on a single server.
* Businesses could now **use spare capacity of existing servers**.

🌟 This was a **game-changer**, creating a **golden age of maximizing server resources**.

## 🐛 VMWarts (Drawbacks of VMs)

But… VMs weren’t perfect. ❌

Each VM needs its **own dedicated operating system (OS)**. This caused several problems:

* 🖥️ Every OS consumed **CPU, RAM, and resources** that should’ve gone to applications.
* 🔧 Every VM + OS required **patching and monitoring**.
* 🐢 VMs were **slow to boot**.
* 📦 VMs were **not portable**.

## 👋 Hello Containers!

While most of us were enjoying VMs, **Google and other web scalers had already moved on → Containers.**

🔑 Key difference:

* Containers **share the host’s OS** instead of needing a full OS per application.

✅ Advantages of containers over VMs:

* ⚡ **Faster**
* 📦 **More portable**
* 🖥️ **More efficient** (e.g., a host that runs 10 VMs can often run **50 containers!**)

## 🐧 Linux Containers

Modern containers were born in the **Linux world** 🐧.
They’re the product of **years of contributions** from many developers and organizations.

🔹 Example:

* **Google** contributed many container-related technologies to the Linux kernel.

### 🔧 Core Technologies Behind Containers:

* **Namespaces**
* **Control Groups (cgroups)**
* **Capabilities**

💡 Problem: Containers were still **complicated to use**.

## 🐳 Docker to the Rescue

Then came **Docker** — the technology that **made containers accessible to the masses**.

> ⚠️ Note: Many container-like technologies existed before Docker.
> But none changed the world 🌍 the way **Docker** has.
